test note C&P

zones

root directory for games (debug v release, change games, catalogue? app data folders?)

something making mode clearer (screenshot vs note), user errors

time travel/review

metadata

metadata map-viz

see-whole-map (auto zoom, cursor without centering)

map connectivity? (can you go N-S here)






(*

-------------------

whole map is like 100x100 and starts you at 50,50

data is big JSON array of bools? if anything exist here

each map tile has its own file on disk of own JSON, something like
 - screenshots: [ TS1, TS2, ... TSN ]
 - note: (text note)
 - meta: [ metas ]

where metas are like a list of things of form
    Meta01: [ {TS1,true}, {TS2,false} ]

And there's some master list of names of the meta categories, e.g.

    Meta01: "Yellow Key"
    Meta02: "Need double jump"

and then some way to add categories.

And then UI is like, defaults to Num5 takes a screenshot, but you can change modes:
    Screenshot
    Text Note
    Meta01Name
    Meta02Name
and like the tiles with any data in that category get a highlight, and pressing Num5 will like
    take screenshot
    give place to edit the text note
    toggle the meta flag
and 'cut/delete' would like erase the last meta entry, so if you accidentally mark a Yellow Key where it's not you can erase it

------------------

And since everything is timestamped you can kinda 'go back in time' or see map evolve over time

// wpf, imagine a big Grid of all the screenshot Images
// can zoom/scroll it to desired on-screen portion
// then can draw gridlines and cursor highlight at a certain thickness atop all that in window pixels

interactions
move cursor with Num2468 
or with click

dropdown change zone (save prompt)
button rename current zone
add new zone (in dropdown?)

dropdown change type (screenshot/note/metaNN)   // better name for 'type' - mode?
if meta
    button rename current meta
    add new meta (in dropdown?)

Num5?Num0?NumEnter? 'add' a thingy (edits existing note)
Num- delete/cut a thingy (need some kind of clipboard viz, and i guess a clipboard per 'type')
    does cutting a screenshot mean taking the whole maptile and all its metadata with it? no
Num+ paste

Num79 zoom in/out (see 1x1/3x3/5x5/... plus a little edges)

Num/ toggle full v zoom, if full, then fit all non-empty into screen area?

state: cursor location, zoom level, isFull
