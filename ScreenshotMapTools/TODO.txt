right click for fullsize image window?


deal with TODOs in code


going back to save location?


always highlighting certain things in certain colors? 
or a hover target to show all hashtags in random colors?
hovering any tag temp highlights it?


maybe turn off meta area (and NUMPAD_STAR cycles) when unused?




naming zones


printing to game folder, all zones, by name, maybe in a date folder


------------------------------------------


and I'm already forgetting keys, need cheatsheet
    2468   move
    0      screenshot
    +-     paste cut
    *      change projection (full screen, map area, metadata area)
    /      edit note
    79     change zoom
    .      toggle #TODO note (e.g. take better notes after this recording session)
    13     unused
mousing: hover shows cell, click to move cursor to that cell
also mousing for infrequent stuff (e.g. key search/highlight)



test manual note C&P

root directory for games (debug v release, change games, catalogue? app data folders?)


Leaf's odysssey also has
 - left HUD
 - screen names like elephantasy
so I probably want to 
 - capture whole screenshot
 - have a projection mechanism to toggle whole versus just map area
 - have a way to capture metadata from a projection and display it too (e.g. grid of screen names, or screen name in summary area)
and I'll be playing/capturing 2x or 3x resolution, so want to downscale screenshots/images like Elephantasy to save disk/processing/etc

so
 + hardcode how to get native 1x screenshot bmps
 + hardcode (for now) the various projections I want (full game, play area, screen name)
 + make VIEWX be 630 (multiple of 1/3/5/7/9) and app width be like 630+20+20
 + make VIEWY be dynamic, adjusting to aspect ratio of current projection, so we always fit e.g. a 5x5 map plus some edges at a zoom level, but the height varies with aspect ratio
 + have a way to select what projection to see now (press NUM-* toggles among three)
 + always show curx/cury meta+full screenshot in the bottom metadata area 


for YT, do I want a minimap projection thingy?
I guess separate OBS scene layout I can toggle is simpler, occasionally do it and break flow



time travel/review

metadata

metadata map-viz

see-whole-map (auto zoom, cursor without centering)

map connectivity? (can you go N-S here)






(*

-------------------

whole map is like 100x100 and starts you at 50,50

data is big JSON array of bools? if anything exist here

each map tile has its own file on disk of own JSON, something like
 - screenshots: [ TS1, TS2, ... TSN ]
 - note: (text note)
 - meta: [ metas ]

where metas are like a list of things of form
    Meta01: [ {TS1,true}, {TS2,false} ]

And there's some master list of names of the meta categories, e.g.

    Meta01: "Yellow Key"
    Meta02: "Need double jump"

and then some way to add categories.

And then UI is like, defaults to Num5 takes a screenshot, but you can change modes:
    Screenshot
    Text Note
    Meta01Name
    Meta02Name
and like the tiles with any data in that category get a highlight, and pressing Num5 will like
    take screenshot
    give place to edit the text note
    toggle the meta flag
and 'cut/delete' would like erase the last meta entry, so if you accidentally mark a Yellow Key where it's not you can erase it

------------------

And since everything is timestamped you can kinda 'go back in time' or see map evolve over time

// wpf, imagine a big Grid of all the screenshot Images
// can zoom/scroll it to desired on-screen portion
// then can draw gridlines and cursor highlight at a certain thickness atop all that in window pixels

interactions
move cursor with Num2468 
or with click

dropdown change zone (save prompt)
button rename current zone
add new zone (in dropdown?)

dropdown change type (screenshot/note/metaNN)   // better name for 'type' - mode?
if meta
    button rename current meta
    add new meta (in dropdown?)

Num5?Num0?NumEnter? 'add' a thingy (edits existing note)
Num- delete/cut a thingy (need some kind of clipboard viz, and i guess a clipboard per 'type')
    does cutting a screenshot mean taking the whole maptile and all its metadata with it? no
Num+ paste

Num79 zoom in/out (see 1x1/3x3/5x5/... plus a little edges)

Num/ toggle full v zoom, if full, then fit all non-empty into screen area?

state: cursor location, zoom level, isFull
